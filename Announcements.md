# Announcements

I'm pleased to announce Sylph v1, a simple Python command-line utility to do #ChatGPT via API instead of web.

v1 is not usable unless you speak #JSON natively, but hopefully that will improve.

I iteratively specified it with ~9 prompts over ~2 hours. #GPT4 wrote the code.

The cool thing: the input and output JSON structures are identical, enabling conversational loops. Just append a new message in the output and feed it back as input!

I'm happy to get issues and PRs.
