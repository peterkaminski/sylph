# Prompts

(These are the prompts to ChatGPT which created the initial program.)

write a python program that interacts with the chatgpt api. it should take input from stdin, and output to either a file or stdout, based on an argument.

change it so the api key is read from an environment variable

modify the program so it saves the input and output in a json file, and so it reads the input from a json file. include the role (system, user, or assistant) in the json file.

modify it so the output is the raw output from the API, and the input reads a JSON file in the same format as the raw output from the API

modify it so it reads input from a JSON file with the same format as the raw API input and saves the output as in the same format as raw API input to a JSON file.

no, the output format is still using the API output format. change it so the output format is the same as the input format.

now change it so it uses the chat completion endpoint, rather than the completion endpoint
