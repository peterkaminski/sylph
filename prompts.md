# Prompts

These are the prompts to ChatGPT which created the initial program.

write a python program that interacts with the chatgpt api. it should take input from stdin, and output to either a file or stdout, based on an argument.

change it so the api key is read from an environment variable

modify the program so it saves the input and output in a json file, and so it reads the input from a json file. include the role (system, user, or assistant) in the json file.
