# Prompts

These are the prompts to ChatGPT which created the initial program.

write a python program that interacts with the chatgpt api. it should take input from stdin, and output to either a file or stdout, based on an argument.

change it so the api key is read from an environment variable

modify the program so it saves the input and output in a json file, and so it reads the input from a json file. include the role (system, user, or assistant) in the json file.

modify it so the output is the raw output from the API, and the input reads a JSON file in the same format as the raw output from the API

modify it so it reads input from a JSON file with the same format as the raw API input and saves the output as in the same format as raw API input to a JSON file.
