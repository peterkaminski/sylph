# Roadmap

Note, there may be some breaking architectural or input/output method changes in future versions to make it easier to add a prompt to the output and feed it back as the input.

Potential enhancements include:

- make it easier to manually add a prompt to the output and feed it back as the input
- make it easy to create new conversations, and leave behind a record of old conversations
- add utilities to work with input and output files; e.g., convert a JSON output file to nicely formatted text
- more options for input and output
- add more input validation and error checking
- subtract the number of input tokens from `max_tokens`
- add logging
- output number of tokens used to logging
